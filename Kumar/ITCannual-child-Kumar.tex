\subsection{Research on the use of ICT for biodiversity conservation（Parajuli Laxmi Kumar）}

% I have been working with Professor Kobayashi on the use of space technology for biodiversity conservation in Nepal. During fiscal year 2022, I discussed with the research officers in National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), Nepal about the possibility of incorporating high technology for nature conservation in Nepal. We also discussed with the locals in Nepal about their needs and how technological intervention is necessary to address their problems. A technical cooperation request was submitted by the NTNC on the use of space technology such as GPS radio collars, drones, infrared sensors, bioacoustics, camera traps and LiDAR technology. I was also involved in writing a perspective paper (Uesaka et al., 2023) in collaboration with the researchers in the laboratory of Professor Kobayashi and two scientists in NTNC, Nepal.
